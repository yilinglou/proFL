ProFL has been implemented as a fully automated Maven plugin, 
which is integrated on the latest byte code program repair tool PraPR. 
To apply ProFL on a Java project,  you only need to 
(1) install ProFL to the local maven repository; 
(2) configure ProFL in the pom.xml of the target subject; 
(3) execute ProFL via maven command.



### 1 Install ProFL
Install the ProFL into the local maven repository. 

```sh
$ mvn clean install -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
```

If you encounter compilation error (e.g., saying signature of a certain method does not match the supplied arguments), probably your local repository contains some of old JAR files downloaded from Maven Central Repo. Please remove them via `rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/pitest` before installation.


### 2 Configure ProFL
Insert the following code into the `pom.xml` of the target project (already inserted for the three example projects).


```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.mudebug</groupId>
	<artifactId>prapr-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
</plugin>
```


### 3 Execute ProFL
Three examples(i.e., Lang-26, Chart-20, and Time-19) are provided.
Passing the example name to the python script `run-example.py` can execute ProFL for the target example subject.

For example, you can execute ProFL on Lang-26 with the following instructions.

```sh
$ cd AE/tool/examples
$ python3 run-example.py Lang-26
```

It would first execute maven compile and test tasks on the project
and then execute ProFL as a maven plugin.

### 4 ProFL Reports
For each subject, the final reports of ProFL are in the subject directory of the `target/prapr-reports/*YYMMDD*/`.
`profl.log` is the fault localization rank list generated by ProFL;
`sbfl.log` is the fault localization rank list generated by spectrum-based fault localization.

We summarize the expected execution information of the three examples as the follows.

Example Name | Bug Method | Ranked by Spectrum | Ranked by ProFL |  Execution Time|
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Lang-17 | format | 17 | 1 | < 2 min|
Chart-20|ValueMarker.init | 5 | 1 | < 2 min|
Time-19| getOffsetFromLocal | 77| 1 | < 10 min|
